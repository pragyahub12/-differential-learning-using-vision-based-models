# Problem Statement
## Differentiating between bird species can be challenging due to subtle differences in features like beaks, claws, and feathers. Manual identification is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to use YOLO and other  techniques to automatically detect and compare bird features using similarity scores and heatmaps. This approach provides a scientific method for studying evolutionary differences and improving bird classification accuracy.
