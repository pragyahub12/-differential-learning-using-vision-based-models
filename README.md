# Problem Statement
## Differentiating between bird species can be challenging due to subtle differences in features like beaks, claws, and feathers. Manual identification is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to use YOLO and other  techniques to automatically detect and compare bird features using similarity scores and heatmaps. This approach provides a scientific method for studying evolutionary differences and improving bird classification accuracy. Here, YOLOv8 makes it possible to locate the specific bird characteristics like eyes, beak, claws, head and feathers inside the pictures.Following feature detection, the differences between two birds' relevant features are visualized using a comparison method based on heatmaps. The structural similarity index (SSIM) is used to quantify this comparison and highlight areas of notable variance. Through the integration of comparative visualization and detection, the project provides an entertaining and instructive tool for learners to recognize and differentiate important bird traits.
